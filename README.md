# WebGL Game Gallery
Welcome to **WebGL Game Gallery** - a small collection of browser-playable games and demos, all built with WebGL and related web technologies.

## 🌐 Website Description
This site is a showcase of simple interactive games and demos that run directly in the browser. Each title uses a WebGL-based canvas (often via a library like three.js)
to render graphics. Enabling both 2D and 3D experiences across desktop and mobile web browsers.

The aim is to offer a variety of fun, lightweight games - from classic arcade-style shooters to casual puzzles- that are easy to launch, either by playing immediately online. ("Play Now") or downloading a build.

## 🎮 Games & Demos (Current Highlights)
On the site, you'll find a number of playable games/demos. Some of them:

* **Live 3D Cube! - ** A simple 3D Cube rendered in WebGL in real time; a demo showing basic 3D rendering directly in your browser.
* **Bowling Online 2 - ** A multiplayer bowling game; you can customize ball appearance, pin/alley visuals, adjust ball weight, and choose different ball-release mechanics.
*  **The Cube -**  Not exactly a "game", but an app that tracks and displays performance statistics: total number of solves, best/worst times, averages over different solve sample sizes. Good for timing-based challenges or practice.
* **Asteroid Shooter - ** A classic arcade-style shooter; pilot a spaceship, destroy waves of asteroids and enemy ships, avoid collisions - aim for a high score.
* **Tic Tac Toe (AI) - ** The classic 3x3 grid game against a bot. A simple, easy-to-access browser version.
* **Cosmic Defenders (BETA) - ** A space-themed 3D shooter built with three.js: navigate through asteroids, destroy threats, power-ups, and survive as long as possible.

Easy listing typically includes two options:
**"Play Now"** to launch directly in your browser, and **"Download"** for users who want to keep a local copy.

## 🔧 Underlying Technologies

* Uses modern web technology - **WebGL**, a standard JavaScript API for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics within web browsers.
* Many of the games/demos likely leverage a JavaScript 3D library (for example, three.js) to simplify rendering, input handling, and scene management.
* Because the games run entirely in the browser, there's no installation needed - compatible with any modern browser that supports WebGL.

## ✅ What Makes This Site Useful/Interesting
* Instant access - No downloads or installations required to play the games; just click "Play Now".
* Varied Content - From simple demos (like a 3D Cube) to full games (shooters, bowling, classic board games), there's something for casual gamers, developers, or people teasing browser graphics performance.
* Open / Easy to experiment with - Downloadable builds let users inspect or play mobile; useful for learning or experimenting with WebGL-based games.
* Web-based / cross-platform - Since it runs in a browser, it's naturally cross-platform (desktop or mobile), as long as the device supports WebGL.

## 📂Project / Repository Structure (What to Expect)
If you fork or clone this project, you'll likely see something like:

* An HTML Page - the main gallery index listing the games.
* Links to "Play Now" - typically pointing to deployed build (hosted e.g. via Netlify, GitHub Pages).
* Download links - for full builds/demos (assets, compiled JS/GL, etc), useful for offline play or study.
* Each game/demonstration likely has its own folder or build directory (with HTML, JS, assets).

## 💡 How to Use / Contribute
* Visit the main page to browse available games/demos.
* Click **"Play Now"** to launch a game immediately in your browser.
* Alternatively, click **"Download"** to get a full copy of the build (useful if you want to run it locally, modify, or review the code).
* If you're a developer: you can fork the repository, add your own WebGL-based games or demos, and update the gallery.
* Visit the main page to browse available games/demos.
* Click **"Play Now"** to launch a game immediately in your browser.
* Alternatively, click **"Download"
